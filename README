I'm running Ubuntu 12.04, and all instructions will be for said OS, so you
will also need to be running it if you want things to make sense. It's a free
operating system and has lots of support so it shouldn't be too much trouble
to install.
Download the ISO from here: (READ NOTE)
http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop
You will need to put it on some kind of media you can boot from. If you have
a cd that would be most convenient. To use a flash drive you will need to
convert the ISO into a format that makes it bootable from a flash drive.

NOTE: As an alternative, you can create a dropbox account and send me your
username and I'll share access with a folder I uploaded containing the usb
iso file.

I don't know what you are reading this on, but you will want SublimeText2.
Follow the instructions here once Ubuntu is installed:

Next, you will need to install git. Run the following command:

sudo apt-get install git

cd into the folder you will be storing this tutorial's files in. then
run the commands:

git clone https://github.com/LiamY/cyberwizard_training.git
git remote add origin https://github.com/liamy/cyberwizard_training.git

Congratulations! You now have the up-to-date version of my code! If I've
made changes since the last time you logged on, you can get them with
the command:

git pull origin master

while you are on the master branch. To check what branch you are on, type:

git branch

For now, you will only ever be pulling from git, without pushing anything.
This is so that I can make sure that no one accidentally overwrites any 
of the tutorial code I've written. For code submission, simply email me
your completed programs.
Before you modify your code, you should create a branch so that you don't
alter the master code. To make a new branch, type:

git branch [new_branch_name]
git checkout [new_branch_name]

this will create a separate copy of the files so that you can modify them
without modifying the original code.
