Welcome to the setup lesson! Each language guide will start with a 0 lesson that consists of necessary
setup needed for use of the language. Since you are running Linux*, you actually already have a C
compiler. This coding challenge consists of the simplest modifications you will be asked to do, with
the purpose of simply showing you how to run your first C program.

1. Check out first.c and modify it as it instructs.

2. In your terminal, navigate to the correct directory and run the commands:
g++ -o first first.c
./first

3. If you get the next instruction, you've got it working!



* Ubuntu is just one of many Linux operating systems. If you are running Ubuntu, you are also running Linux.

** If you were curious about the above commands, here is a simple explanation:
'g++' invokes the gnu c/c++ compiler, '-o' specifies that an object file is to be created alongside an
executable, 'first' specifies the name of the executable, and 'first.c' specifies what file to use to 
create the executable
'./' is the command used to run an executable.
